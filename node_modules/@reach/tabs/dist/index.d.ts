/**
 * Welcome to @reach/tabs!
 *
 * An accessible tabs component.
 *
 * The `Tab` and `TabPanel` elements are associated by their order in the tree.
 * None of the components are empty wrappers, each is associated with a real DOM
 * element in the document, giving you maximum control over styling and composition.
 *
 * You can render any other elements you want inside of `Tabs`, but `TabList`
 * should only render `Tab` elements, and `TabPanels` should only render
 * `TabPanel` elements.
 *
 * @see Docs     https://reacttraining.com/reach-ui/tabs
 * @see Source   https://github.com/reach/reach-ui/tree/master/packages/tabs

     * Allows you to switch the orientation of the tabs relative to their tab
     * panels. Defaults to `"horizontal-start"`.
     *
     * `horizontal-` and `vertical-` orientations will change how the arrow keys
     * navigate between tabs. Arrow key navigation should logically follow the
     * order in which tabs appear on the screen. For screen reader users, the
     * `aria-orientation` attribute provides the appropriate context to direct
     * which keys should navigate to the next tab (this is provided
     * automatically).
     *
     * `-start` and `-end` props should be determined by the DOM order of rendered
     * components. If the `TabList` component appears before `TabPanels`, the
     * `horizontal-start` or `vertical-start` should be used. When the `TabList`
     * component appears after `TabPanels`, use `horizontal-end` or
     * `vertical-end`. For vertical tabs, this will change whether or not
     * `ArrowLeft` or `ArrowRight` moves the user into the active panel.
     *
     * If you're familiar with the relatively new specs for CSS logical
     * properties, you'll know why we opt to use `start` and `end` rather than
     * `left`, `right`, `top` or `bottom`. The `Tabs` component supports writing
     * modes other than left-to-right, and `Tabs` will adapt keyboard controls to
     * the match user's writing mode and the given orientation.
